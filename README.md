     **THEVENIN MODEL OF MICROPHONE**
     
   ***Key specs from the microphone [datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/0/5/8/b/1/SPH8878LR5H-1_Lovato_DS.pdf) and research:***
     
   - Sensitivty: -44 dBV/Pa.
   - Condition: 94 dB SPL at 1 kHz which is sound pressure of 1 Pa.
   - Normal voice conversation is typically 60 dB SPL.
     
   -  **Vth Calculation**

μVpk

      - Vout - pk =
      0.178 mV

- Rth (from datasheet) = 380 ohms.

- Sparkfun Schematic of the breakout Board   [Link](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/7/5/6/e/d/SparkFun_Analog_MEMS_Microphone_Breakout_SPH8878LR5H-1.pdf).
- From Sparkfun schematic: Rin=5k, Rfb=300k, therefore Gain = 60.
- So output of the amplfier will be 60x0.178 mVpk = 10.68 mVpk.
- Sparkfun site states 100 mVpk probaby assuming 10 times higher input signal i.e. Voice is 80 dB SPL.
- Input high-pass frequency =  1 / 2πRC = 1 / 2π5k4.7uF = 6.77Hz.
- Feedback Low-pass filter frequency =  1 / 2πRC = 1 / 2π300k27pF = 19.6kHz.
- Input common-mode filter =  1 / 2π10k1uF = 15.9Hz.


**Single-Pole Model of OPA 344**

  - Specs from the [OP344 Datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/opa344.pdf?ts=1747822666491&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F).

       - Open Loop DC Gain: 120 dB (From p-5 graph).
   
       - Unity Gain Frequency: 1 MHz.
  - *Pole = 1 MHz / 10^6= 1Hz*.

      - -3 dB frequency.
      -  10X -3 dB frequency.
        
    - Measure the peak-to-peak voltage at the output and calculate the gain.
